Travel site is a responsive website with a bunch of features such as lazy loading images, cool effects, responsive images, and modern practices.

With this project I have learned new technologies such as webpack, NPM, BEM architecture, JavaScript uses, and a lot of git commands

Technologies used:
  - HTML5
  - CSS3
  - JavaScript
  - PostCSS
  - BEM
  - Webpack
  - NPM
  - Git
